# Welcome 


... to this interactive web-based Jupyter Book, designed to guide you through the process of replicating examples from Wooldridge's renowned textbook, "**Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach. 6ed.**" This resource aims to enhance your understanding of econometric concepts and techniques by providing codes using Python.

I hope this resource serves as a valuable companion to Wooldridge's textbook, making econometrics more accessible and enjoyable through the power of Python.

For those interested in Stata and/or R versions of the replication exercises, please refer to the following links, [Stata](http://solomonegash.com/woodridge1/index.html) and [R](http://solomonegash.com/econometrics/rbook1/index.html), respectively.

Happy learning!
